1) Gather data:  -->  nasdaq100 dataset.ipynb
2) Auto-Arima Model: --> AUTOARIMA-14 test 1 part B.ipynb
3) RNN "LSTM" Model: --> RNN - LSTM- THE BEST.ipynb
4) TensorBoard: --> TENSORBOARD AND HYPERPARAMETERS.ipynb

The logs folder is where I stored every training model for Hyperparameters' combinations.
